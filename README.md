# Sorting-Visualizer
A visual way to understand how different sorting algorithms work behind the scenes. Written with Java using Javafx
- Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort are shown to visual perfection. 
- Due to known threading issues related to Javafx and Thread.sleep function, Merge Sort and Quick Sort tend to glitch out in some cases.
- All sorts work behind the scenes, but some have GUI related threading issues with Javafx that I am trying to fix
